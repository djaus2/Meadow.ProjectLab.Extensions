# MeadowProjectLabExtensions

Extended demo projects for Meadow ProjectLab.

This project is based upon the [Meadow ProjectLab_Demo](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.ProjectLab/tree/main/Source/). It needs the project **Meadow.ProjectLab** located with that project. _(You need to clone that GitHub project and then add the Meadow.ProjectLab project as a project reference to this project.)_
The WiFi functionality is based upon the [Meadow.Core.Samples WiFi_Basics](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow.Core.Samples/tree/main/Source/Network/WiFi_Basics/CS) project. It demonstrates using the display in a reusable manner, as a menu. The user selects a network from the locally found WiFi access poinst and then selects from a given list of passwords.


> Nb: Currently a .netstandard2.1 project
